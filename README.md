Movies Data Analysis and Visualization using Python
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize a dataset named movies_updated.csv, which contains various attributes related to movies. Using Python, we explore trends and insights through multiple visualization techniques.

Project Workflow
1. Loading the Dataset
The dataset movies_updated.csv is loaded using Pandas for data manipulation.
We inspect the dataset for missing values, data types, and overall structure.
2. Data Visualization
To better understand the data, we use Seaborn and Matplotlib to generate different visualizations:

ðŸ“Š Pair Plot
Used to visualize pairwise relationships between numerical variables in the dataset.
Helps in identifying correlations and patterns between attributes.

ðŸŽ» Violin Plot
Combines a box plot with a density plot, showing data distribution and probability density.
Useful for comparing the distribution of movie ratings, revenues, or other numerical features.

ðŸ“ˆ Line Plot
Shows trends over time, such as changes in movie ratings or box office collections.
Helps in understanding patterns and fluctuations across different periods.

ðŸ“Š Bar Graph (with Value Annotations)
Displays categorical comparisons, such as the number of movies per genre or average ratings per category.
Value annotations are added on top of each bar to highlight exact values for better readability.

ðŸ¥§ Pie Chart
Used to represent categorical distribution, such as the percentage of movies belonging to different genres or production studios.
